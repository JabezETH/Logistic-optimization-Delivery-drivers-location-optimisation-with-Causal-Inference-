# Logistic-optimization-Delivery-drivers-location-optimisation-with-Causal-Inference-

## Objective

Gokada - the largest last mile delivery service in Nigeria. Gokada Works is partnered with motorbike owners and drivers to deliver parcels across Lagos, Nigeria. Gokada has completed more than a million deliveries in less than a year, with a fleet of over 1200 riders.
One key issue Gokada has faced as it expands its service is the sub-optimal placement of pilots (Gokada calls their motor drivers pilots) and clients who want to use Gokada to send their parcel. This has led to a high number of unfulfilled delivery requests.
Gokada is asking , to work on its data to help it understand the primary causes of unfulfilled requests as well as come up with solutions that recommend drivers locations that increase the fraction of complete orders. Since drivers are paid based on the number of requests they accept, your solution will help Gokada business grow both in terms of client satisfaction and increased business.
